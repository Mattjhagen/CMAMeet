A Letter to Anyone New to CMA
Dear Friend,

Thank you for your interest in Crystal Meth Anonymous. We are a fellowship of people for whom all drugs, specifically crystal meth, have become a problem. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop using. There are no dues or membership lists. The fellowship that is CMA is a new way of life without Crystal Meth. CMA advocates a twelve step recovery program for spiritual development, no matter what our religious belief or background. Our first step in recovery is our admission that we are powerless over crystal meth — that life has become unmanageable.

The experience of CMA members is that Crystal Meth Addiction is a progressive illness that cannot be cured, but which, like some other illnesses, can be arrested, by not using, one day at a time. CMA members are happy to offer help by sharing their experience, strength and hope in how they stay clean & sober. One of the ways members stay clean & sober is by helping other Crystal Meth Addicts to achieve sobriety.

It is often helpful for the crystal meth addict to talk with another CMA member, because it may make it easier to understand the nature of our illness, and to accept the help the fellowship of CMA can offer. We would encourage you to get in touch with the General Services Office or the nearest local group near you to get further information on Crystal Meth Anonymous, speak to a CMA member or find local CMA meetings. Many of these local groups have email and/or phone numbers.

Our website navigation system includes links to CMA pamphlets plus readings that explain how members of our fellowship used a “12 step program of recovery”. And to give a general idea of how CMA works.

Best Wishes,

General Services Office
